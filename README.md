Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm presently focused on my custom StarCraft WebGL renderer called [Titan Reactor](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/titan-reactor). I also work on my [Youtube channel!](http://youtube.imbateam.gg)

StarCraft related utilities that may be found in the monorepo.

- [Titan Reactor](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/titan-reactor) - Open source OpenBW Renderer with plugins written in TypeScript, Three.JS and Electron.
- [Titan Reactor Plugins](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/titan-reactor-official-plugins) - Plugins available for Titan Reactor
- [Downgrade Replay](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/downgrade-replay) - a partial replay downgrader from SCR to SC1.16, or [use the online version](https://scr2bw.glitch.me/).
- [DAT Parsers](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/titan-reactor/tree/dev/src/common/bwdat) and [Graphics Parsers](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/titan-reactor/tree/dev/src/renderer/image/formats)
- [Commands Stream](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/titan-reactor/blob/dev/src/renderer/process-replay/commands/commands-stream.ts) - Pass in a command buffer from a replay (using something like [bw-chk](https://github.com/ShieldBattery/bw-chk))
