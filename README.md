Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm presently focused on my custom StarCraft WebGL renderer called [Titan Reactor](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/titan-reactor). I showcase some of that as well on the ImbaTeam [Youtube channel!](http://youtube.imbateam.gg)

In my day job I focus on product design and UX acting as consultant to our many divisions and companies.

Get in touch! Find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/imbateam), [Youtube](http://youtube.imbateam.gg), or [the Titan Reactor Discord](http://discord.imbateam.gg).
